Implementing Linked list , stack and queue in C++ 



A linked list is a data structure used in computer science to store a collection of elements. Unlike arrays, which store elements in contiguous memory locations, linked lists store elements in nodes, where each node contains both the data and a reference (or pointer) to the next node in the sequence.

**Here are the key components of a linked list:**

Node: Each element in a linked list is stored in a node. A node typically contains two parts: the data, which holds the value of the element, and a pointer/reference to the next node in the sequence.
Head Pointer: The head pointer points to the first node of the linked list. It serves as the entry point to the list and allows traversal of the list by following the pointers from one node to the next.
Tail Pointer (Optional): In some implementations, a tail pointer may be used to point to the last node of the list. This can facilitate quick insertion at the end of the list.
Linked lists offer several advantages and disadvantages compared to other data structures:

**Advantages**:

Dynamic Size: Linked lists can grow or shrink in size dynamically, as memory is allocated and deallocated on demand.
Efficient Insertion and Deletion: Insertion and deletion operations can be performed quickly and efficiently, especially when dealing with large lists, as they involve adjusting pointers rather than shifting elements like in arrays.
Memory Efficiency: Linked lists only use as much memory as necessary to store the elements and pointers, without the need for pre-allocation.

**Disadvantages**:

Sequential Access: Unlike arrays, linked lists do not provide direct access to elements by index. Accessing an element in a linked list requires traversing the list from the beginning.
Memory Overhead: Linked lists require extra memory to store the pointers/references to the next node, which can increase memory overhead compared to arrays, especially for small elements.
Pointer Overhead: Manipulating pointers in linked lists can introduce overhead, especially in memory-constrained environments.
There are different types of linked lists, such as singly linked lists (each node points to the next node), doubly linked lists (each node points to both the next and previous nodes), and circular linked lists (the last node points back to the first node). Each type has its own advantages and use cases.
